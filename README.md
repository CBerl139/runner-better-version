# runner-better-version
ENSEA TD Project runner
"better version" because previous version was bad so i had to reorganize the code from scratch

# How to import this project in IntelliJ IDE :

1. In the IDE, go to File > New > Project from Version Control, under URL paste this repEveryo's url (found under Code > HTTPS)
2. Make sure you have javafx downloaded in a file where you can find it
3. Go to File > Project Structure > Libraries > Add, and copy the path of the /lib folder of javafx
4. In the top right, click on Main > Edit configuration, under VM options, replace the file path (C:/...) with your /lib folder's file path

You can now run the code. Everything should work fine.
If the IDE tells you that there is a problem with the JDK, click on solve automatically and wait for the download to end, then run the code again
